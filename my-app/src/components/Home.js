            <p style={{ margin: "auto", width: "60%" }}>Hi {name}I am a full stack developer and analyst....so probably a data Analyst.
                I am currently studying Economics and Computer Science at Boston University.
                I am also a trustee scholar at BU. Mary is as beautiful as a Hollywood star.
                Her thick, wavy, long black hair gracefully falls down to her shoulders and encircles her diamond-shaped face.
                A golden suntan usually brings out her smooth, clear complexion and high cheek bones.
                Her slightly arched chestnut brown eyebrows highlight her emotions by moving up and down as she reacts to her world around her.
                Her large deep blue eyes, remind me of a lake on a stormy day. Her curved nose gives her a little girl look that makes me want to smile when she talks. And her mouth is a small mouth outlined by puffy lips that she often accentuates with glossy pink lipstick. When she smiles, which is often, her well formed and even, white teeth brighten up her whole face. I guess you can tell that I am head over heals in love with Mary.
